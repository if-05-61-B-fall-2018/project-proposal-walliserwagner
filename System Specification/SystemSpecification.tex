\section{Initial Situation and Goal}

\subsection{Initial Situation}

Members of a typical household must go shopping for groceries at least once a week. A lot of households use grocery lists to organise that process. Problems that could occur are that the grocery list gets lost or if the list is in use nobody else can add shopping items to the list. It also could happen that multiple lists get written because of miscommunication between the members of a household.

Furthermore things get more complex when the combination of recipe books and grocery lists is considered. The items found in different recipe books have to be manually transferred to the shopping list. 

These processes could be simplified by using a grocery list app.

\subsubsection{Application Domain}
Most people write a shopping list before they go shopping. When one member of a household goes shopping they only buy the products they wrote down. To not forget a product they have to communicate with every member of the household and ask them which items they want. Furthermore the items are written down in the order the writer is thinking of them, but in the store they want the items to be sorted according to the departments they belong to.

\subsection{Goal Definition}

The main goal of our system is to speed up and simplify the process of going shopping and storing recipes. We especially want to help people living and shopping together so they need to spend less time talking about groceries. The system also helps managing and sharing ones recipes and lists because it is way more unlikely to lose or misplace ones recipes and shopping lists.
Our target group is every person that goes shopping but we especially want to cater to households with multiple members.

\section{Quantity Structure}

Every user has a nickname, password and e-mail. All configuration from every user concerning items, shopping lists and recipes will be saved in order to be independent of devices. Every recipe that is created inside of a group will be added to ones recipe book. A group has its own items, shopping lists and recipes it also has every member.
